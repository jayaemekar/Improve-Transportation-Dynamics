# An attempt to Improve Transportation Dynamics through analysis of Transportation Networks

In large cities or urban conglomerations, where movement of people or goods by foot is not a viable option, vehicular movement is the way forward. With the advancement of technology, vehicles are now easier to afford and maintain, and are the lifelines for people who commute and transportation of heavy goods alike.
A road transportation network consists of junctions represented by vertices and roads or streets connecting the junctions represented by edges between the vertices. Essentially it is a spatial network, since the vertices and edges associated with it are spatial elements which are linked to geometric objects which are the vertices of the network.

The motivation of this project is to employ some of the interesting tools and metrics of network science to analyze an important road transportation network and employ these analyses in an attempt to improve the network itself. The importance of nodes and edges using centrality measures, and the structure of the network by virtue of quantities like clustering coefficient and diameter are important and interesting to note. Enhancements in the network include, but are not limited to
Identifying the importance of junctions and roads in the network in context of traffic flow
Pinpointing bottlenecks in the network in context of heavy traffic flow
